## Introduction
Sea surface temperature (SST) is the ocean surface temperature and is a very crucial physical aspect of the planet’s oceans. Temperature of the sea measured varies from methods of surface consideration, but it is between 1 millimeter to up to 7 feet which is 20 meters under the sea surface. The present paper discusses the constant changes over the past few decades on Sea surface temperature due to significant variations in the environment caused by anthropogenic and natural factors on Baltic Sea. Baltic Sea which is considered as a study region because the increasing trend of temperature is relatively high than the world average trend of increase. For identifying and determining the changes from 2000 to 2020, Cloud based platform of Google earth engine is being considered for the analysis. For detection of Sea surface temperature advanced remote sensing and GIS technologies had proved to be very efficient for visualization due to high resolution data. The paper had analyzed a rapid increase in temperature over the years. This analysis will help researchers and scientist for multiple climatic studies and process of decision-making.

The Baltic is a juvenile shallow sea to be found in the Northern Europe. It is a semi-enclosed sea situated between 100 E to 54oN and 310E to 660 N. Second largest area of brackish water is covered by Baltic Sea. It has merely a fine link with the Belt Seas and North Sea through the resonance, Baltic Sea is mainly moderately isolated from other oceans. About 59 percent of the area of drainage of Baltic is covered by ten leading streams namely Kymi, Oder, Daugava, Vistula, Neman, Göta, Narva, Kemi, Torne, and Neva. 
The standard deepness of the sea is just 56 m. About 480 km3 of atmospheric input and river runoff were added as freshwater to the Baltic Sea on an annual basis. The area of drainage is about 4 times bigger than the area of its surface and is colonized by approximately eightyfive million natives. Baltic Sea is positioned in a zone of temperate climate. The south parts have gentle and humid winters whereas the areas of north regions have generally strong and middle iciness.

## Objectives of the Study

The primary aim of this paper is to monitor the changes in Sea surface temperature over the years. Baltic Sea which is considered as a study region because the increasing trend of temperature is relatively high than the world average trend of increase. This study will help in better visualization and understanding of the reasons and area which had experienced maximum amount of change over the years. This paper also aims of comparing different datasets of two sensors, to analyse which dataset is more suitable for temperature study of the ocean surface study in future. The study aims at three major objectives:
- To visualize the changes in sea surface temperature and analyse their causes and differences over the years.
- To compare year wise temperature trend.
- To compare two sensors of datasets NOAA and MODIS

## Google Earth Engine Code Editor

The only method is used in this project to calculate the sea surface temperature of Baltic sea is JavaScript in Google Earth Engine Code Editor. In this code editor, we have used JavaScript to build a model for sea surface temperature. Here, two types of datasets are taken i.e., NOAA and MODIS Aqua to process it with the algorithm. This code editor has been used to visualize NOAA dataset for 2000 – 2010 years and MODIS Aqua dataset for 2010 – 2020 years. From these datasets, year wise comparison as well as datasets comparison has been done and visualized.
In Google Earth Engine Code Editor, data is processed and filtered by dates and years to achieve objectives of the project. Also, the conversion of kelvin to Celsius process is done to get the sea surface temperature. Systematic and appropriate parameters are been applied to data to achieve the sea surface temperature of Baltic sea.

The above figures represent the sea surface temperatures of Baltic sea for 2000 and 2010 years. This dataset is used to visualize NOAA which is having AVHRR sensor detects the highest and lowest temperatures of the Baltic sea. From the above models, it can be clearly analysed that the sea surface temperature is low in 2000 as compared to 2010. Figure 2 shows the highest temperature around Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia basin regions and lowest temperature around Sweden basin region in 2000 year. Figure 3 shows the highest temperature in Russia, Poland and bottom part of Sweden basin regions and lowest temperature in Germany, Denmark and upper part of Sweden basin regions. From these two models, it is analysed that sea surface temperature is decreased from 2000 to 2010 years.

The above figures represent the sea surface temperature of Baltic sea from 2010 to 2020 years. The dataset used to visualize SST is MODIS Aqua. Figure 4 shows the sea surface temperature for 2010 year having the lowest temperature as compared to 2020 year. Figure 5 shows the highest sea surface temperature as compared to 2010 year. From these two-model mentioned above, it is analysed that the sea surface temperature is increased from 2010 to 2020 years.

## Graphical Representations of Sea Surface Temperatures

From these graphical representations of the SST, it can be analysed that the SST in 2000 is lowest on 19th July and highest on 30th July. SST in 2010 is highest on 16th July and lowest on 17th July. SST in 2020 is lowest on 11th July and highest on 20th July. From these graphical models, we analysed that SST in 2000 is not uniform. In 2010, SST suddenly dropped and increased in 2020 year.

## Trend of Minimum and Maximum Temperature of Baltic Sea

Minimum and maximum temperatures are collected and visualized in a graphical pattern from 2000 to 2020 years.

These two models represented above shows the comparison between two data products which are NOAA and MODIS Aqua for the same year 2014. By doing this process, we analysed that MODIS product is better than NOAA product. MODIS improves upon the performance of AVHRR by providing both spatial resolution and greater spectral resolution, enabling more detailed analysis of the study area. Because, MODIS has 500 meters of resolution and NOAA – AVHRR has 4000 meters of resolution. While the bias between the datasets can be found precisely for specific geographic areas to analyse temporal trends including such phenomena.

## Factors affecting SST

In this project, we have mentioned some factors which are affecting the sea surface temperature growth. These affecting factors to SST are mentioned below.
1. North Atlantic Oscillations (NAO) Index
2. El Nino – La Nina

## Conclusions

The project is done to identify and determine the changes in sea surface temperature of Baltic sea for 2000 – 2010 – 2020 years. By this project, we can understand the temperature trend and fluctuations in sea surface temperature as well as factors affecting the growth of SST. It is important to observe and monitor the SST for any climatic disturbances or environmental 
issues.
In this project, we analysed that the SST is suddenly increased from 2000 to 2010 and gradually decreased in 2020 year. These models represented in the projects are built in Google Earth 
Engine as mentioned above. By this JavaScript, anyone can access the code and replace the location, change the data product and filter the date and year of their choices. The code is only meant to calculate the sea surface temperature.
Results of the study indicates that the remote sensing and GIS technologies are very useful to detect and monitor the SST of any area of interest. These technologies or the code can be useful to anyone to observe the trend of temperature and its growth.
